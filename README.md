Assignment Questions:
Model the Problem.
We want to find a correlation between pre-k students and thier performance while on a pre-k program, and then a correlation between pre-k and non-prek students when they enter in K, 1st. grade.

Determine the approach:
To find a way to measure the improvement or not of students while in the pre-k program, we scatter plotted the students on different metrics and then we did a linear regression to find the rate of change.

Then we repeat this same technique to compare pre-k students and non pre-k students when they are together in k and 1st. grade and see if there is a difference in progress while comparing both groups.

Lastly we need to perform this same technique to compare the pre-k students progress while in the pre-k program based on school and am/pm shifts, and see if there is a performance difference between them

Evaluation:
All these evaluations where performed in the jupyter notebook provided in this hw.
