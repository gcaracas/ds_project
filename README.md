Assignment Questions:
Model the Problem.
We want to find a correlation between pre-k students and thier performance while on a pre-k program, and then a correlation between pre-k and non-prek students when they enter in K, 1st. grade.

Determine the approach:
To find a way to measure the improvement or not of students while in the pre-k program, we scatter plotted the students on different metrics and then we did a linear regression to find the rate of change.

Then we repeat this same technique to compare pre-k students and non pre-k students when they are together in k and 1st. grade and see if there is a difference in progress while comparing both groups.

Lastly we need to perform this same technique to compare the pre-k students progress while in the pre-k program based on school and am/pm shifts, and see if there is a performance difference between them

Evaluation:
All these evaluations where performed in the jupyter notebook provided in this hw.



How did we spent the time at class on the 12th. and 14th.
November 12th. 
Aparna and Gerardo met at the classroom at 12:00p.m. and worked there until 1:15 pm. The first 15 min, we talked about the cluster assignment and the rest of the time we perform an analysis to find out if the pre-k students have a different learning rate while in pre-k program between schools (2 sampled schools) and between am or pm programs.
We found that between schools there is no much difference, but the am students significally underperformed compared with their pm counterparts. In short, pm is better for pre-k students.

November 14th.
Just as the 12th. we met at the classroom at 12:00 pm and we left at 1:15 pm. 
We spent about 15 min. talking about the cluster assignment, and then the rest of the time we worked on this homework, writting this report and cleaning up a bit our notebook.
